"""Stage-1 generator (two-stage planner) — DRY-RUN by default.

Pipeline: planning_brief (deterministic) -> LLM proposes the week's SHAPE only
(sport + time-at-intensity segments + notes, NO load/fuelling/structure maths) ->
plan_builder.build_sessions (deterministic render + load + fuel + validate) -> audit.

The LLM is tightly constrained: it may only use the session types and this-week doses
in the brief, must respect day_rules and the TID, and outputs pure JSON. All numbers
come from code. Nothing is pushed unless --push is given AND validation is clean.

  python3 stage1-plan.py --athlete kathryn            # dry-run, prints the built week
  python3 stage1-plan.py --athlete kathryn --push     # push (only if validation clean)

Output ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fence:
{{"sessions": [{{"date":"YYYY-MM-DD","sport":"Swim|Bike|Run|Brick|Strength",
  "name":"short name","notes":"coaching prose (cues, purpose)",
  "segments":[{{"minutes":N,"zone":"<zone from the menu>"}}, ...]}}]}}

HARD RULES — you propose the SHAPE only; code computes all load/fuelling/structure:
- Use ONLY session types and zones from AVAILABLE SESSIONS below. Do NOT invent types.
- For a quality session, build its main set from that type's "this_week" dose (reps×min);
  wrap with an easy warm-up and cool-down. If "ramp_in" is true, keep it conservative.
- Respect DAY RULES: swim_days/bike_days/run_days set which sports go on which day, and
  place an easy/rest day. If day_rules has "swim_focus" (or run_focus/bike_focus) mapping a
  weekday to allowed session type(s), that day's session of that sport MUST be one of those
  types — e.g. swim_focus {{"Tue":["technique","speed"],"Thu":["css"]}} means Tue swim is a
  skills/speed session and Thu swim is the CSS set, never the reverse.
- Aim the week near the WEEKLY TSS TARGET and follow the intensity split (TID = low/mod/high %).
- Swim sets: express in minutes (not metres). Strength: omit segments.
- Do NOT output load_target, TSS numbers, or %FTP/pace targets — code derives them.
